Run Traffic_Data.ipyb to generate traffic_cams_final.csv and all_data.csv  These csv files were then read into other jupyter notebooks for analysis  Table outputs are stored in the Results folder Figures and graphs are stored in the Images folder
Please note that you will need to save a config.py file on your computer. You will need a google key which is referred to as gkey in the jupyter notebook. You will also need an API key for census data. This is referred to as api_key in the jupyter notebook.
